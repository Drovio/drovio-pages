# Drovio Pages

DrovIO Pages are the presentation layer of DrovIO. 
They fetch the needed information from the core and the database and they present it to the final user. 
They also store information to the database for later use.

They may use all of DrovIO's services and they run under security privileges (with user groups) for each module.

This repository contains:
* All the core resource, including media and files that helped develop Drovio
* A ReadMe webDoc that contains all the information within this README.md
* All the sources files, including commits and releases using Drovio's vcs system
  * Drovio's vcs system kept info in database. All information is dumped in `Source/.db/`
